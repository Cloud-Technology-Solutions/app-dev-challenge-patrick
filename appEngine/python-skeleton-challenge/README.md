Some pointers

- You can use any IDE you like
- Make sure to read and follow the 'Before you begin' section (skip the create a project, we did this for you) on https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/quickstart
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt -t lib --no-cache-dir` to install the packages before deploying
- You can deploy the application by running `gcloud app deploy --project YOUR-PROJECT-ID`
- Your free to change the project in anyway you need / like to complete the challenge.
- If you use any extra python packages add them to the requirements.txt and install them running the pip command above
